This page contains full-system files that have been distributed with
gem5 in the past, but are deprecated/legacy files. The files linked on
the [Download](Download "wikilink") page should be used instead of
these. They are here to simply document what has been available in the
past.

  - [Tarballs of generic file systems](http://www.linaro.org/downloads/)
    are available from [Linaro](http://www.linaro.org). Scroll down to
    the *Developers and Community Builds* section. Some work will be
    required to make these suitable for simulation, but they're a
    reasonable starting point.
  - [ARMv8 Full-System
    Files](http://www.gem5.org/dist/current/arm/arm64-system-02-2014.tgz)
    -- Pre-compiled kernel and disk image for the 64 bit ARMv8 ISA.
  - [VExpress_EMM kernel w/PCI support and
    config](http://www.gem5.org/dist/current/arm/vmlinux-emm-pcie-3.3.tar.bz2)
    -- Pre-compiled Linux 3.3 VExpress_EMM kernel that includes support
    for PCIe devices, a patch to add gem5 PCIe support to the revision
    [of the vexpress kernel
    tree](http://www.gem5.org/dist/current/arm/linux-arm-arch.tar.bz2)
    and a config file. This kernel is needed if you want to simulated
    more than 256MB of RAM or networking. Pass
    `--kernel=/path/to/vmlinux-3.3-arm-vexpress-emm-pcie
    --machine-type=VExpress_EMM` on the command line. You'll still need
    the file systems below. This kernel supports a maximum of 2047MB
    (one MB less than 2GB) of memory.
  - [New Full System
    Files](http://www.gem5.org/dist/current/arm/arm-system-2011-08.tar.bz2)
    -- Pre-compiled Linux kernel, and file systems, and kernel config
    files. This includes both a cut-down linux and a full ubuntu linux.
  - [Old Full System
    Files](http://www.m5sim.org/dist/current/arm/arm-system.tar.bz2) --
    Older pre-compiled Linux kernel, and file system. New users should
    use package above. This wil likely be removed soon.
