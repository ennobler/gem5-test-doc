We have held a handful of tutorials on M5 at various conferences. Though
the material in these tutorials can be out of date, the tutorial
materials present a more organized (and in some cases more in-depth)
overview than the wiki documentation. We highly recommend taking a look
at the most recent tutorial as a complement to the documentation on the
wiki.

The slides and handouts are the same material except that the handouts
are formatted with two slides per page.

## ICS 2018: Vector Architecture Exploration with gem5

[Vector Architecture Exploration with
gem5](http://gem5.org/ICS2018_gem5_SVE_Tutorial)

International Conference on Supercomputing, Beijing (China), June 2018

This tutorial covers the Arm Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) and how to
use gem5 to explore system architecture designs of microarchitectures
implementing SVE.

## Arm Research Starter Kit on System Modeling using gem5

<https://github.com/arm-university/arm-gem5-rsk>

Getting started instructions and an overview of the HPI model.

## ISCA 45: AMD gem5 APU Model

[AMD gem5 APU Simulator: Modeling GPUs Using the Machine
ISA](http://gem5.org/ISCA_2018_Tutorial)

This tutorial covers the gem5 APU model in detail. In particular, we
discuss the model's support for executing GPU machine ISA instructions
and the full user space ROCm stack.

## Arm Research Summit 2017: gem5 workshop

[ARM Research Summit 2017
Workshop](ARM_Research_Summit_2017_Workshop "wikilink") covers many
advanced topics in gem5 such as Ruby, Garnet, and SystemC.

## dist-gem5 at ISCA-44 (Toronto, 2017)

dist-gem5 is a gem5-based simulation infrastructure which enables
full-system simulation of a parallel/distributed computer system using
multiple simulation hosts.

ASPLOS 2017](http://gem5.org/ASPLOS2017_tutorial)

## HiPEAC Computer Systems Week

This tutorial was held in Gothenburg, Sweden in April 2012. It covers
gem5 although for information about Ruby you should look at the ISCA 38
tutorial. We recorded video of the tutorial which is available
    below.

## ISCA 38

This tutorial, held in June 2011 at ISCA-38, it covered gem5 (the merger
between M5 and GEMS). It was extremely well attended with 65 people
participating.

  - Podcasts/video coming soon provided there are no technical
    difficulties

## ASPLOS-13

This tutorial, held in March 2008 at ASPLOS XIII in Seattle, covered M5
2.0 and included several small examples on creating SimObjects and
adding
        parameters.

## ISCA-33

This tutorial, held in June 2006 at ISCA 33 in Boston, was the first one
to cover M5 2.0.
