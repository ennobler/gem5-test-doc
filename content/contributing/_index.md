If you've made changes to gem5 that might benefit others, we strongly encourage
you to contribute those changes to the public gem5 repository. There are
several reasons to do this:

  * Share your work with others, so that they can benefit from new functionality.
  * Support the scientific principle by enabling others to evaluate your
   suggestions without having to guess what you did.
  * Once your changes are part of the main repo, you no longer have to merge
   them back in every time you update your local repo. This can be a huge time
   saving!
  * Once your code is in the main repo, other people have to make their changes
   work with your code, and not the other way around.
  * Others may build on your contributions to make them even better, or extend
   them in ways you did not have time to do.
  * You will have the satisfaction of contributing back to the community.

The main method for contributing code to gem5 is via our code review website:
https://gem5-review.googlesource.com/. This documents describes the details of
how to create code changes, upload your changes, have your changes
reviewed, and finally push your changes to gem5. More information can be found
