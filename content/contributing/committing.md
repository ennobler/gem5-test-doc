Each patch must meet the following criteria to be merged:

 * At least one review with +2
 * At least one maintainer with +1
 * At least +1 from the CI tests (gem5 must build and run)
 * At least +1 from the style checker

Once a patch meets the above criteria, the submitter of the patch will be able
to merge the patch by pressing the "Submit" button on Gerrit. When the patch is
submitted, it is merged into the public gem5 branch.
