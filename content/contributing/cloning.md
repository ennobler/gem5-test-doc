If you plan on contributing, it is strongly encouraged for you to clone the
repository directly from our gerrit instance at
https://gem5.googlesource.com/.

To clone the master gem5 repository:
```
 git clone https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5
```

Other gem5 repositories
-----------------------

There are a few repositories other than the main gem5 development repository.

 * public/m5threads: The code for a pthreads implementation that works with
   gem5's syscall emulation mode.

Other gem5 branches
-------------------

None right now.
