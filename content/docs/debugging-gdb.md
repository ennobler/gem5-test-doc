If traces alone are not sufficient, you'll need to inspect what gem5 is
doing in detail using a debugger (e.g., gdb). You definitely want to use
the gem5.debug binary if you reach this point. Ideally, looking at
traces should at least allow you to narrow down the range of cycles in
which you think something is going wrong. The fastest way to reach that
point is to use a `DebugEvent`, which goes on gem5's event queue and
forces entry into the debugger when the specified cycle is reached by
sending the process a SIGTRAP signal. You'll need to to start gem5 under
the debugger or have the debugger attached to the gem5 process for this
to work.

You can create one or more DebugEvents when you invoke gem5 using the
`"--debug-break=100"` parameter. You can also create new DebugEvents
from the debugger prompt using the `schedBreak()` function. The
following example session illustrates both of these approaches:

    % gdb m5/build/ALPHA/gem5.debug
    GNU gdb 6.1
    Copyright 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    [...]
    (gdb) run --debug-break=2000 configs/run.py
    Starting program: /z/stever/bk/m5/build/ALPHA/gem5.debug --debug-break=2000 configs/run.py
    M5 Simulator System
    [...]
    warn: Entering event queue @ 0.  Starting simulation...

    Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
    0xffffe002 in ?? ()
    (gdb) p curTick
    $1 = 2000
    (gdb) c
    Continuing.

    (gdb) call schedBreak(3000)
    (gdb) c
    Continuing.

    Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
    0xffffe002 in ?? ()
    (gdb) p _curTick
    $3 = 3000
    (gdb)

gem5 includes a number of functions specifically intended to be called
from the debugger (e.g., using the gdb 'call' command, as in the
`schedBreak()` example above). Many of these are "dump" functions which
display internal simulator data structures. For example, `eventq_dump()`
displays the events scheduled on the main event queue. Most of the other
dump functions are associated with particular objects, such as the
instruction queue and the ROB in the detailed CPU model. These
include:

| function                     | Effect                                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `schedBreak(`<tick>`)`       | Schedule a SIGTRAP to occur at <tick>   |
| `setDebugFlag("`<flag>`")`   | Enable a debug flag from the debugger   |
| `clearDebugFlag("`<flag>`")` | Disable a debug flags from the debugger |
| `eventqDump()`               | Print out all events on the event queue |
| `takeCheckpoint(`<tick>`)`   | Create a checkpoint at cycle <tick>     |

Additional gdb-accessible features for debugging coherence protocols in
the classic memory system are documented
[here](Classic_Memory_System#Debugging "wikilink").

## Debugging Python with PDB

You can debug configuration scripts with the [Python debugger
(PDB)](http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html) just as you would other
Python scripts. You can enter PDB before your configuration script is
executed by giving the `--pdb` argument to the gem5 binary. Another
approach is to put the following line in your configuration script
(e.g., fs.py or se.py) wherever you would like to enter the debugger:

    import pdb; pdb.set_trace()

Note that the Python files under `src` are compiled in to the gem5
binary, so you must rebuild the binary if you add this line (or make
other changes) in these files. Alternatively, you can set the
M5_OVERRIDE_PY_SOURCE environment variable to "true" (see
`src/python/importer.py`).

See the [official PDB
documentation](http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html) for more details
on using PDB.
