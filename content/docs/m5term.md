The m5term program allows the user to connect to the simulated console
interface that full-system m5 provides. Simply change into the util/term
directory and build m5term:

```
    % cd m5/util/term
    % make
    gcc  -o m5term term.c
    % make install
    sudo install -o root -m 555 m5term /usr/local/bin
```

The usage of m5term is:

```
    ./m5term <host> <port>

    <host> is the host that is running m5

    <port> is the console port to connect to. m5 defaults to
    using port 3456, but if the port is used, it will try the next
    higher port until it finds one available.

    If there are multiple systems running within one simulation,
    there will be a console for each one.  (The first system's
    console will be on 3456 and the second on 3457 for example)

    m5term uses '~' as an escape character.  If you enter
    the escape character followed by a '.', the m5term program
    will exit.
```

m5term can be used to interactively work with the simulator, though
users must often set various terminal settings to get things to work

A slightly shortened example of m5term in action:

```
    % m5term localhost 3456
