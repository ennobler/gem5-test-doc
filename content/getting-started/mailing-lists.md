gem5 has two main mailing lists where you can ask for help or advice. 
Before posting a problem to the mailing list **please read [Reporting
Problems](Reporting_Problems "wikilink") and follow the guidelines
listed.** Doing so will get your question answered far faster and more
precisely.


There are two mailing lists for gem5 hosted on gem5.org:

  - gem5-dev
    [(subscribe)](http://www.gem5.org/mailman/listinfo/gem5-dev) -
    gem5-dev is for developers who are working on the main version of gem5. This is the
    version that's distributed from the website and most likely what you'll base
    your own work off of.  Bug reports should be sent here.
    This list receives emails from Gerrit reviews and cron test results.
  - gem5-users
    [(subscribe)](http://www.gem5.org/mailman/listinfo/gem5-users) -
    General discussion about gem5 and its use. gem5-users is a larger mailing list and is for people
    working on their own projects which are not, at least initially, going to be
    distributed as part of the official version of gem5. Most of the time
    gem5-users is the right mailing list to use.
  - gem5-announce
    [(subscribe)](http://www.gem5.org/mailman/listinfo/gem5-announce) -
    Announcements related to gem5.

Additional (and much more easily searchable) archives are hosted

## Alternative communication channels

The following alternative support communication channels also exist,
although they are less canonical not as actively monitored by the
developers currently.

If you don't get an answer in those channels quickly, make sure to also
send the full text of your post to the correct mailing list with an
additional link to the original post.
