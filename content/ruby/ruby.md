## High level components of Ruby

Ruby implements a detailed simulation model for the memory subsystem. It
models inclusive/exclusive cache hierarchies with various replacement
policies, coherence protocol implementations, interconnection networks,
DMA and memory controllers, various sequencers that initiate memory
requests and handle responses. The models are modular, flexible and
highly configurable. Three key aspects of these models are:

1.  Separation of concerns -- for example, the coherence protocol
    specifications are separate from the replacement policies and cache
    index mapping, the network topology is specified separately from the
    implementation.
2.  Rich configurability -- almost any aspect affecting the memory
    hierarchy functionality and timing can be controlled.
3.  Rapid prototyping -- a high-level specification language, SLICC, is
    used to specify functionality of various controllers.

The following picture, taken from the GEMS tutorial in ISCA 2005, shows
a high-level view of the main components in Ruby.

### SLICC + Coherence protocols:

***[SLICC](SLICC "wikilink")*** stands for *Specification Language for
Implementing Cache Coherence*. It is a domain specific language that is
used for specifying cache coherence protocols. In essence, a cache
coherence protocol behaves like a state machine. SLICC is used for
specifying the behavior of the state machine. Since the aim is to model
the hardware as close as possible, SLICC imposes constraints on the
state machines that can be specified. For example, SLICC can impose
restrictions on the number of transitions that can take place in a
single cycle. Apart from protocol specification, SLICC also combines
together some of the components in the memory model. As can be seen in
the following picture, the state machine takes its input from the input
ports of the inter-connection network and queues the output at the
output ports of the network, thus tying together the cache / memory
controllers with the inter-connection network itself.

The following cache coherence protocols are supported:

1.  **[MI_example](MI_example "wikilink")**: example protocol, 1-level
    cache.
2.  **[MESI_Two_Level](MESI_Two_Level "wikilink")**: single chip,
    2-level caches, strictly-inclusive hierarchy.
3.  **[MOESI_CMP_directory](MOESI_CMP_directory "wikilink")**:
    multiple chips, 2-level caches, non-inclusive (neither strictly
    inclusive nor exclusive) hierarchy.
4.  **[MOESI_CMP_token](MOESI_CMP_token "wikilink")**: 2-level caches.
    TODO.
5.  **[MOESI_hammer](MOESI_hammer "wikilink")**: single chip, 2-level
    private caches, strictly-exclusive hierarchy.
6.  **[Garnet_standalone](Garnet_standalone "wikilink")**: protocol to
    run the Garnet network in a standalone manner.
7.  **[MESI Three Level](MESI_Three_Level "wikilink")**: 3-level caches,
    strictly-inclusive hierarchy.

Commonly used notations and data structures in the protocols have been
described in detail [here](Cache_Coherence_Protocols "wikilink").

### Protocol independent memory components

1.  **Sequencer**
2.  **Cache Memory**
3.  **Replacement Policies**
4.  **Memory Controller**

In general cache coherence protocol independent components comprises of
the Sequencer, Cache Memory structure, Cache Replacement policies and
the Memory controller. The Sequencer class is responsible for feeding
the memory subsystem (including the caches and the off-chip memory) with
load/store/atomic memory requests from the processor. Every memory
request when completed by the memory subsystem also send back the
response to the processor via the Sequencer. There is one Sequencer for
each hardware thread (or core) simulated in the system. The Cache Memory
models a set-associative cache structure with parameterizable size,
associativity, replacement policy. L1, L2, L3 caches (if exists)in the
system are instances of Cache Memory. The Cache Replacement policies are
kept modular from the Cache Memory, so that different instances of Cache
Memory can use different replacement policies of their choice. Currently
two replacement polices -- LRU and Pseudo-LRU -- are distributed with
the release. Memory Controller is responsible for simulating and
servicing any request that misses on all the on-chip caches of the
simulated system. Memory Controller currently simple, but models DRAM
ban contention, DRAM refresh faithfully. It also models close-page
policy for DRAM buffer.

***Each component is described in details
[here](Coherence-Protocol-Independent_Memory_Components "wikilink").***

### Interconnection Network

The interconnection network connects the various components of the
memory hierarchy (cache, memory, dma controllers) together.

![Interconnection_network.jpg](Interconnection_network.jpg
"Interconnection_network.jpg")

The key components of an interconnection network are:

1.  **Topology**
2.  **Routing**
3.  **Flow Control**
4.  **Router Microarchitecture**

***More details about the network model implementation are described
[here](Interconnection_Network "wikilink").***

Alternatively, Interconnection network could be replaced with the
external simulator [TOPAZ](http://www.atc.unican.es/topaz/). This
simulator is ready to run within gem5 and adds a significant number of
[features](https://sites.google.com/site/atcgalerna/home-1/publications/files/NOCS-2012_Topaz.pdf?attredirects=0)
over original ruby network simulator. It includes, new advanced router
micro-architectures, new topologies, precision-performance adjustable
router models, mechanisms to speed-up network simulation, etc ... The
presentation of the tool (and the reason why is not included in the gem5
repostories) is

## Life of a memory request in Ruby

In this section we will provide a high level overview of how a memory
request is serviced by Ruby as a whole and what components in Ruby it
goes through. For detailed operations within each components though,
refer to previous sections describing each component in isolation.

1.  A memory request from a core or hardware context of gem5 enters the
    jurisdiction of Ruby through the ***RubyPort::recvTiming***
    interface (in src/mem/ruby/system/RubyPort.hh/cc). The number of
    Rubyport instantiation in the simulated system is equal to the
    number of hardware thread context or cores (in case of
    *non-multithreaded* cores). A port from the side of each core is
    tied to a corresponding RubyPort.
2.  The memory request arrives as a gem5 packet and RubyPort is
    responsible for converting it to a RubyRequest object that is
    understood by various components of Ruby. It also finds out if the
    request is for some PIO or not and maneuvers the packet to correct
    PIO. Finally once it has generated the corresponding RubyRequest
    object and ascertained that the request is a *normal* memory request
    (not PIO access), it passes the request to the
    ***Sequencer::makeRequest*** interface of the attached Sequencer
    object with the port (variable *ruby_port* holds the pointer to
    it). Observe that Sequencer class itself is a derived class from the
    RubyPort class.
3.  As mentioned in the section describing Sequencer class of Ruby,
    there are as many objects of Sequencer in a simulated system as the
    number of hardware thread context (which is also equal to the number
    of RubyPort object in the system) and there is an one-to-one mapping
    between the Sequencer objects and the hardware thread context. Once
    a memory request arrives at the ***Sequencer::makeRequest***, it
    does various accounting and resource allocation for the request and
    finally pushes the request to the Ruby's coherent cache hierarchy
    for satisfying the request while accounting for the delay in
    servicing the same. The request is pushed to the Cache hierarchy by
    enqueueing the request to the *mandatory queue* after accounting for
    L1 cache access latency. The *mandatory queue* (variable name
    *m_mandatory_q_ptr*) effectively acts as the interface between
    the Sequencer and the SLICC generated cache coherence files.
4.  L1 cache controllers (generated by SLICC according to the coherence
    protocol specifications) dequeues request from the *mandatory queue*
    and looks up the cache, makes necessary coherence state transitions
    and/or pushes the request to the next level of cache hierarchy as
    per the requirements. Different controller and components of SLICC
    generated Ruby code communicates among themselves through
    instantiations of *MessageBuffer* class of Ruby
    (src/mem/ruby/buffers/MessageBuffer.cc/hh) , which can act as
    ordered or unordered buffer or queues. Also the delays in servicing
    different steps for satisfying a memory request gets accounted for
    scheduling enqueue-ing and dequeue-ing operations accordingly. If
    the requested cache block may be found in L1 caches and with
    required coherence permissions then the request is satisfied and
    immediately returned. Otherwise the request is pushed to the next
    level of cache hierarchy through *MessageBuffer*. A request can go
    all the way up to the Ruby's Memory Controller (also called
    Directory in many protocols). Once the request get satisfied it is
    pushed upwards in the hierarchy through *MessageBuffer*s.
5.  The *MessageBuffers* also act as entry point of coherence messages
    to the on-chip interconnect modeled. The MesageBuffers are connected
    according to the interconnect topology specified. The coherence
    messages thus travel through this on-chip interconnect accordingly.
6.  Once the requested cache block is available at L1 cache with desired
    coherence permissions, the L1 cache controller informs the
    corresponding Sequencer object by calling its ***readCallback*** or
    **'writeCallback**'' method depending upon the type of the request.
    Note that by the time these methods on Sequencer are called the
    latency of servicing the request has been implicitly accounted for.
7.  The Sequencer then clears up the accounting information for the
    corresponding request and then calls the
    ***RubyPort::ruby_hit_callback*** method. This ultimately returns
    the result of the request to the corresponding port of the core/
    hardware context of the frontend (gem5).
