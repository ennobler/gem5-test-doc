A cache coherence protocol usually has several different types of state
machines, with state machine having several different states. For
example, the MESI CMP directory protocol has four different state
machines (L1, L2, directory, dma). Testing such a protocol for
functional correctness is a challenging task. gem5 provides a random
tester for testing coherence protocols. It is called the Ruby Random
Tester. The source files related to the tester are present in the
directory **src/cpu/testers/rubytest**. The file
**configs/examples/ruby_random_test.py** is used for configuration and
execution of the test. For example, the following command can be used
for testing a protocol --

    ./build/X86/gem5.fast ./configs/example/ruby_random_test.py

Though one can specify many different options to the random tester, some
of them are note
worthy.

| Parameter          | Description                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **-n, --num-cpus** | Number of cpus injecting load/store requests to the memory system. |
| **--num-dirs**     | Number of directory controllers in the system.                     |
| **-m, --maxtick**  | Number of cycles to simulate.                                      |
| **-l, --checks**   | Number of loads to be performed.                                   |
| **--random_seed** | Seed for initialization of the random number generator.            |

Testing a coherence protocol with the random tester is a tedious task
and requires patience. First, build gem5 with the protocol to be tested.
Then, run the ruby random tester as mentioned above. Initially one
should run the tester with a single processor, and few loads. It is
likely that one would encounter problems. Use the debug flags to get a
trace of the events ocurring in the system. You may find the flag
**ProtocolTrace** particularly useful. As these are rectified, keep on
increasing the number of loads, say by a factor of 10 each time till one
can execute one to ten million loads. Once it starts working for a
single processor, a similar process now needs to be followed for a two
processor system, followed by larger systems.

Theoretical approaches exist for verifying coherence protocols\[1\], but
gem5 currently does not include any testers based on those.
