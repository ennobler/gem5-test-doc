### Protocol Overview

  - This is a simple cache coherence protocol that is used to illustrate
    protocol specification using SLICC.
  - This protocol assumes a 1-level cache hierarchy. The cache is
    private to each node. The caches are kept coherent by a directory
    controller. Since the hierarchy is only 1-level, there is no
    inclusion/exclusion requirement.
  - This protocol does not differentiate between loads and stores.
  - This protocol cannot implement the semantics of LL/SC instructions,
    because external GETS requests that hit a block within a LL/SC
    sequence steal exclusive permissions, thus causing the SC
    instruction to fail.

### Stable States and Invariants

| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **M**  | The cache block has been accessed (read/written) by this node. No other node holds a copy of the cache block |
| **I**  | The cache block at this node is invalid                                                                      |

### Cache controller

  - Requests, Responses, Triggers:
      - Load, Instruction fetch, Store from the core
      - Replacement from self
      - Data from the directory controller
      - Forwarded request (intervention) from the directory controller
      - Writeback acknowledgement from the directory controller
      - Invalidations from directory controller (on dma activity)

  - Main Operation:
      - On a **load/Instruction fetch/Store** request from the core:
          - it checks whether the corresponding block is present in the
            M state. If so, it returns a hit
          - otherwise, if in I state, it initiates a GETX request from
            the directory controller

<!-- end list -->

  -   - On a **replacement** trigger from self:
          - it evicts the block, issues a writeback request to the
            directory controller
          - it waits for acknowledgement from the directory controller
            (to prevent races)

<!-- end list -->

  -   - On a **forwarded request** from the directory controller:
          - This means that the block was in M state at this node when
            the request was generated by some other node
          - It sends the block directly to the requesting node
            (cache-to-cache transfer)
          - It evicts the block from this node

<!-- end list -->

  -   - **Invalidations** are similar to replacements

### Directory controller

  - Requests, Responses, Triggers:
      - GETX from the cores, Forwarded GETX to the cores
      - Data from memory, Data to the cores
      - Writeback requests from the cores, Writeback acknowledgements to
        the cores
      - DMA read, write requests from the DMA controllers

  - Main Operation:
      - The directory maintains track of which core has a block in the M
        state. It designates this core as owner of the block.
      - On a **GETX** request from a core:
          - If the block is not present, a memory fetch request is
            initiated
          - If the block is already present, then it means the request
            is generated from some other core
              - In this case, a forwarded request is sent to the
                original owner
              - Ownership of the block is transferred to the requestor
      - On a **writeback** request from a core:
          - If the core is owner, the data is written to memory and
            acknowledgement is sent back to the core
          - If the core is not owner, a NACK is sent back
              - This can happen in a race condition
              - The core evicted the block while a forwarded request
                some other core was on the way and the directory has
                already changed ownership for the core
              - The evicting core holds the data till the forwarded
                request arrives
      - On **DMA** accesses (read/write)
          - Invalidation is sent to the owner node (if any). Otherwise
            data is fetched from memory.
          - This ensures that the most recent data is available.

### Other features

  -   - MI protocols don't support LL/SC semantics. A load from a remote
        core will invalidate the cache block.
      - This protocol has no timeout mechanisms.
