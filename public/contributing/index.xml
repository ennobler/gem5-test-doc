      <title>Making changes to gem5</title>
      <link>http://localhost/contributing/changes/</link>

      <description>It is strongly encouraged to use git branches when making changes to gem5. Additionally, keeping changes small and concise and only have a single logical change per commit.
Unlike our previous flow with Mercurial and patch queues, when using git, you will be committing changes to your local branch. By using separate branches in git, you will be able to pull in and merge changes from mainline and simply keep up with upstream changes.</description>

 At least one review with +2 At least one maintainer with +1 At least +1 from the CI tests (gem5 must build and run) At least +1 from the style checker  Once a patch meets the above criteria, the submitter of the patch will be able to merge the patch by pressing the &amp;ldquo;Submit&amp;rdquo; button on Gerrit.

      <description>Overview gem5 is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project. Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project design and participate in the decision-making process. Historically, gem5 development has been carried out both in industry and in academia. This document describes how that participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within the project community.
The document is broken into a number of sections.</description>
