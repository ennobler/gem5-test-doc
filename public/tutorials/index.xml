      <description>Second gem5 User Workshop
 June 14th, 2015; Portland, OR
       Following up from a successful 2012 workshop, it is time for the 2015 edition of the gem5 user workshop. The primary objective of this workshop is to bring together groups across the community who are actively using gem5. Discussion topics will include the activity of the gem5 community, how we can best leverage each others contributions, and how we continue to make gem5 a successful, community-supported simulation framework.</description>

      <description>First gem5 User Workshop
 December 2012; Vancouver, BC
       The primary objective of this workshop is to bring together groups across the community who are actively using gem5, discuss what is going on in the gem5 community, how we can best leverage each others contributions, and how we continue to make gem5 a successful community-supported simulation framework. Those who will get the most out of the conference are current users of gem5, although anyone is welcome to attend.</description>

      <description>Call for Participation: ISCA 2011 Tutorial gem5: A Multiple-ISA Full System Simulator with Detailed Memory Modeling Sunday, June 5, 2011 8:30 am http://www.gem5.org The gem5 simulator is a merger of two of the computer architecture community’s most popular, open source simulators: M5 and GEMS. The best features of each simulator have been combined to provide an infrastructure capable of simulating multiple ISAs, CPU models, memory system components, cache coherence protocols and interconnection networks.</description>

      <description>Using the M5 Simulator ISCA 2006 Tutorial Sunday June 18th, 2006
Introduction This half-day tutorial will introduce participants to the M5 simulator system. M5 is a modular platform for computer system architecture research, encompassing system-level architecture as well as processor microarchitecture.
We will be releasing version 2.0 of M5 in conjunction with this tutorial. Features new in 2.0 include:
 Multiple ISA support (Alpha, MIPS, and SPARC) An all-new, execute-in-execute out-of-order SMT CPU timing model, with no SimpleScalar license encumbrance All-new, message-oriented interface for memory system objects, designed to simplify the development of non-bus interconnects More extensive Python integration and scripting support  Because the primary focus of the M5 development team has been simulation of network-oriented server workloads, M5 incorporates several features not commonly found in other simulators.</description>

      <description>The ARM Research Summit is an academic summit to discuss future trends and disruptive technologies across all sectors of computing. On the first day of the Summit, ARM Research will host a gem5 workshop to give a brief overview of gem5 for computer engineers who are new to gem5 and dive deeper into some of gem5&amp;rsquo;s more advanced capabilities. The attendees will learn what gem5 can and cannot do, how to use and extend gem5, as well as how to contribute back to gem5.</description>

      <description>Using the M5 Simulator ASPLOS 2008 Tutorial Sunday March 2nd, 2008
Introduction This half-day tutorial will introduce participants to the M5 simulator system. M5 is a modular platform for computer system architecture research, encompassing system-level architecture as well as processor microarchitecture.
We will be discussing version 2.0 of the M5 simulator and specifically its new features including:
 Multiple ISA support (Alpha, ARM, MIPS, and SPARC) An execute-in-execute out-of-order SMT CPU timing model, with no SimpleScalar license encumbrance Message-oriented interface for memory system objects, designed to simplify the development of non-bus interconnects New caches models that are easier to modify New multi-level bus-based coherence protocol More extensive Python integration and scripting support Performance improvements Generating checkpoints for simpoints  Because the primary focus of the M5 development team has been simulation of network-oriented server workloads, M5 incorporates several features not commonly found in other simulators.</description>

      <title>ISC-2018 Vector Architecture Exploration</title>
      <link>http://localhost/tutorials/ics-2018/</link>

      <description>Vector Architecture Exploration with gem5 (Arm) Abstract The Arm Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) is a key enabling technology to accelerate HPC and machine learning workloads on future Arm-based processors. SVE does not set a specific vector length, which is microarchitecture-specific. This vector-length agnosticism increases design space complexity and exacerbates the importance of having flexible and accurate modeling tools.
gem5 is an open-source full-system microarchitectural simulator that is widely used in academia and industry.</description>
