MV5  MV5 is a reconfigurable simulator for heterogeneous multicore architectures. It is based on M5v2.0 beta 4. Typical usage: simulating data-parallel applications on SIMT cores that operate over directory-based cache hierarchies. You can also add out-of-order cores to have a heterogeneous system, and all different types of cores can operate under the same address space through the same cache hierarchy.</description>
