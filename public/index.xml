      <description>gem5 is a modular discrete event driven computer system simulator platform. That means that:
 gem5&amp;rsquo;s components can be rearranged, parameterized, extended or replaced easily to suit your needs. It simulates the passing of time as a series of discrete events. Its intended use is to simulate one or more computer systems in various ways. It&amp;rsquo;s more than just a simulator; it&amp;rsquo;s a simulator platform that lets you use as many of its premade components as you want to build up your own simulation system.</description>

      <description>Build System gem5&amp;rsquo;s build system is based on SCons, an open source build system implemented in Python. You can find more information about scons at http://www.scons.org. The main scons file is called SConstruct and is found in the root of the source tree. Additional scons files are named SConscript and are found throughout the tree, usually near the files they&amp;rsquo;re associated with.
Build targets In gem5, scons build targets are of the form //.</description>

      <description>Introduction The simplest method of debugging is to have gem5 print out traces of what it&amp;rsquo;s doing. The simulator contains many DPRINTF statements that print trace messages describing potentially interesting events. Each DPRINTF is associated with a debug flag (e.g., Bus, Cache, Ethernet, Disk, etc.). To turn on the messages for a particular flag, use the --debug-flags command line argument. Multiple flags can be specified by giving a list of strings, e.</description>

      <description>X86_64 is defined to support physical memory addresses up to 52 bits long. Because M5 uses 64 bit integers for addresses, every physical address has 12 extra bits which aren&amp;rsquo;t directly accessible to the software running on the simulated CPU. M5 uses those bits to differentiate between different physical address spaces which are allocated for various purposes. In order to maximize the space given to the actual address portion of the address, the bits that select the address space grown down from the MSB as they&amp;rsquo;re allocated.</description>

First, the native variable length instructions will be translated into &amp;ldquo;fixed width&amp;rdquo; instructions. These instructions will be too large to represent with native data types, so they will be stored as structures.</description>

      <description>It is strongly encouraged to use git branches when making changes to gem5. Additionally, keeping changes small and concise and only have a single logical change per commit.
Unlike our previous flow with Mercurial and patch queues, when using git, you will be committing changes to your local branch. By using separate branches in git, you will be able to pull in and merge changes from mainline and simply keep up with upstream changes.</description>

      <description>gem5 runs on Linux and Mac OS X, but should be easily portable to other Unix-like OSes. At times in the past gem5 has worked on OpenBSD and Microsoft Windows (under Cygwin), but these platforms are not regularly tested. Cygwin in particular is no longer actively supported; if you must run on a Windows host, we recommend installing Linux (e.g., Ubuntu Server) under a VM and running gem5 there. Free virtualization solutions such as VirtualBox and VMware Player work well for this usage.</description>

      <description>Overview http://m5sim.org/graphics/InstructionExecution.png
X86 instruction encodings have several unique characteristics which make them harder to deal with than the encodings for the other ISAs M5 supports. Despite that, x86 is decoded using the same basic mechanisms as the other ISAs.
At the lowest level, instructions can take any number of bytes (up to a maximum) and can have any alignment. That means that when a CPU brings in bytes of memory to decode, it may contain several instructions, the end of one and the start of the next, the middle of an instruction, etc.</description>

      <description>Let’s start by building a basic x86 system. Currently, you must compile gem5 separately for every ISA that you want to simulate. Additionally, if using ruby, you have to have separate compilations for every cache coherence protocol.
To build gem5, we will use SCons. SCons uses the SConstruct file (gem5/SConstruct) to set up a number of variables and then uses the SConscript file in every subdirectory to find and compile all of the gem5 source.</description>

      <description> Modes \= System-call Emulation (SE) mode is one of the two modes of gem5 and the most basic. gem5 simulates your program and traps any system calls made to the host then emulates them. In the older versions of gem5, only statically linked binaries were allowed to be simulated in SE mode however, gem5 2.0 now supports dynamically linked binaries. Not all architecutres support dynamically linked binaries

      <description>Microop Parameter Specialization Microops are not, in general, written in an absolute sense. They are templates which provide an implementation for a macroop, but need to be specialized using the arguments of the original instruction. In hardware, this appears to be handled in two different ways depending on the origin of the microop. In the case of combinationally generated microops, the instructions are actually generated with the correct parameters in place.</description>

      <description>Register Ops These microops typically take two sources and produce one result. Most have a version that operates on only registers and a version which operates on registers and an immediate value. Some optionally set flags according to their operation. Some of them can be predicated.

add Dest, Src1, Src2 Dest = Dest &amp;lt;- Src1 + Src2
Adds the contents of the Src1 and Src2 registers and puts the result in the Dest register.</description>

      <description>Segment bases When computing an address for a load or store, the segment base is added in before the address is sent to the CPU to actually perform the access. This has several advantages. First, because there are no alignment restrictions on segment bases, the virtual (pre-segmentation) address for an access could be aligned but produce an unaligned linear (post-segmentation) address. The opposite could also happen where an unaligned access becomes aligned.</description>

      <description>This section needs to be updated; no mercurial; should reference Contribuing
 If you find the need to modify or extend gem5, you may be tempted to just start editing files in your local gem5 repository. While this approach will work initially, it will cause problems if/when you decide to update your copy of gem5 with changes that have been made since you originally cloned the repository. It&amp;rsquo;s very likely that you will want to update your code to get bug fixes and new features.</description>

      <description>should be updated for gem5
 Overview First, make sure you have basic understanding of how the CPU models function within the M5 framework. A good start is the CPU Models page.
This brief tutorial will show you how to create a custom CPU model called &amp;lsquo;MyCPU&amp;rsquo;, which will just be a renamed version of the AtomicSimpleCPU. After you learn how to compile and build &amp;lsquo;MyCPU&amp;rsquo;, then you have the liberty to edit the &amp;lsquo;MyCPU&amp;rsquo; code at your heart&amp;rsquo;s content without worrying about breaking any existing M5 CPU Models.</description>

      <description>First gem5 User Workshop
 December 2012; Vancouver, BC
       The primary objective of this workshop is to bring together groups across the community who are actively using gem5, discuss what is going on in the gem5 community, how we can best leverage each others contributions, and how we continue to make gem5 a successful community-supported simulation framework. Those who will get the most out of the conference are current users of gem5, although anyone is welcome to attend.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not clear if this is still up-to-date
 To run workloads in gem5, we advise you to use Workload Automation (WA). This framework allows you to run workloads automatically on Android and Linux platforms. More information can be found here: https://github.com/ARM-software/workload-automation
What do I need? To use WA together with gem5 you will need to make changes to the host system and the guest system. These changes will enable 9P over virtio, which will allow for files to be transported into the simulation.</description>

      <description>The EXTRAS SCons option is a way to add functionality in gem5 without adding your files to the gem5 source tree. Specifically, it allows you to identify one or more directories that will get compiled in with gem5 as if they appeared under the &amp;lsquo;src&amp;rsquo; part of the gem5 tree, without requiring the code to be actually located under &amp;lsquo;src&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s present to allow user to compile in additional functionality (typically additional SimObject classes) that isn&amp;rsquo;t or can&amp;rsquo;t be distributed with gem5.</description>

A &amp;ldquo;nickle tour&amp;rdquo; of flattening and register indexing in the CPU models.
First, an instruction has identified that it needs register such and such as determined by its encoding (or the fact that it always uses a certain register, or &amp;hellip;). For the sake of argument, lets say we&amp;rsquo;re talking about SPARC, the register is %g1, and the second bank of globals is active.</description>

Tips for Making Your Disk Image gem5 Friendly Speeding Up the Boot Process When a fresh Android image is booted it generates a lot of files and does a lot of JIT compiling; this can slow down the boot process significantly. gem5 uses a copy-on-write (COW) layer between the simulator and the actual disk image, because of this COW layer none of the changes are stored to the disk image.</description>

      <description>Since MIPS and SPARC use branch delay slots, we&amp;rsquo;re faced with an interesting issue on how to implement them correctly. There are two issues: basic support for branch delay slots, and support for conditionally executed delay-slot instructions (SPARC &amp;ldquo;annulled&amp;rdquo; delay slots).
Basic functionality In the context of M5 instruction execution, PC is the current instruction&amp;rsquo;s PC and NPC is the PC of the next instruction. Conventional non-delayed branches (as in Alpha) write to NPC to change the next instruction executed.</description>

      <description>gem5 has multiple implemented replacement policies. Each one uses its specific replacement data to determine a replacement victim on evictions.
All of the replacement policies prioritize victimizing invalid blocks.
Altough most of the replacement policies don&amp;rsquo;t need a counter of the number of references to an entry, or the insertion timestamp, they are by default updated by every replacement policy, due to their usage in the statistics.
Random The simplest replacement policy; it does not need replacement data, as it randomly selects a victim among the candidates.</description>

      <description>Checkpoints Checkpoints are essentially snapshops of a simulation. You would want to use a checkpoint when your simulation takes an extremely long time (which is almost always the case) so you can resume from that checkpoint at a later time with the DerivO3CPU.
Creation First of all, you need to create a checkpoint. Each checkpoint as saved in a new directory named &amp;lsquo;cpt.TICKNUMBER&amp;rsquo;, where TICKNUMBER refers to the tick value at which this checkpoint was created.</description>

      <description>M5&amp;rsquo;s new memory system (introduced in the first 2.0 beta release) was designed with the following goals:
 Unify timing and functional accesses in timing mode. With the old memory system the timing accesses did not have data and just accounted for the time it would take to do an operation. Then a separate functional access actually made the operation visible to the system. This method was confusing, it allowed simulated components to accidentally cheat, and prevented the memory system from returning timing-dependent values, which isn&amp;rsquo;t reasonable for an execute-in-execute CPU model.</description>

      <description>We strive to maintain a consistent coding style in the M5 source code to make the source more readable and maintainable. This necessarily involves compromise among the multiple developers who work on this code. We feel that we have been successful in finding such a compromise, as each of the primary M5 developers is annoyed by at least one of the rules below. We ask that you abide by these guidelines as well if you develop code that you would like to contribute back to M5.</description>

      <description>gem5 runs on Linux and Mac OS X, but should be easily portable to other Unix-like OSes. At times in the past gem5 has worked on OpenBSD and Microsoft Windows (under Cygwin), but these platforms are not regularly tested. Cygwin in particular is no longer actively supported; if you must run on a Windows host, we recommend installing Linux (e.g., Ubuntu Server) under a VM and running gem5 there. Free virtualization solutions such as VirtualBox and VMware Player work well for this usage.</description>

      <description>Cross Compilers A cross compiler is a compiler set up to run on one ISA but generate binaries which run on another. You may need one if you intend to simulate a system which uses a particular ISA, Alpha for instance, but don&amp;rsquo;t have access to actual Alpha hardware. There are various sources for cross compilers, listed here in roughly recommended order:

      <description>If traces alone are not sufficient, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to inspect what gem5 is doing in detail using a debugger (e.g., gdb). You definitely want to use the gem5.debug binary if you reach this point. Ideally, looking at traces should at least allow you to narrow down the range of cycles in which you think something is going wrong. The fastest way to reach that point is to use a DebugEvent, which goes on gem5&amp;rsquo;s event queue and forces entry into the debugger when the specified cycle is reached by sending the process a SIGTRAP signal.</description>

      <description>System This is a high level container for few of the important components of the Ruby which may need to be accessed from various parts and components of Ruby. Only ONE instance of this class is created. The instance of this class is globally available through a pointer named g_system_ptr. It holds pointer to the Ruby&amp;rsquo;s profiler object. This allows any component of Ruby to get hold of the profiler and collect statistics in a central location by accessing it though g_system_ptr.</description>

      <description>Below is a list of projects that are based on gem5, are extensions of gem5, or use gem5.
MV5  MV5 is a reconfigurable simulator for heterogeneous multicore architectures. It is based on M5v2.0 beta 4. Typical usage: simulating data-parallel applications on SIMT cores that operate over directory-based cache hierarchies. You can also add out-of-order cores to have a heterogeneous system, and all different types of cores can operate under the same address space through the same cache hierarchy.</description>

      <description>The Directed Tester is for generating a stream of requests, where two consecutive requests are separated by a fixed number of bytes. The requests can be a mix of reads and writes, or they can be invalidations. This can be useful in testing a prefetcher or for generally testing a coherence protocol implemented in Ruby. The source files related to the tester are present in the directory src/cpu/testers/directedtest. The file configs/examples/ruby_direct_test.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost/docs/disk-images/</guid>
      <description>Background   Disk image basics A disk device in gem5 gets its initial contents from a file called a disk image. This file stores all the bytes present on the disk just as you would find them on an actual device. Some other systems also use disk images which are in more complicated formats and which provide compression, encryption, etc. gem5 currently only supports raw images, so if you have an image in one of those other formats, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to convert it into a raw image before you can use it in a simulation.</description>

      <description>This page provides some high-level information about Events in M5 including how to create, schedule, and remove them.
The simplest way to use events is to create an EventWrapper which lets you wrap an arbitrary function (that is based on a SimObject with an event that can occur). An illustrative example is probably the easiest way to describe the issue:
class Bar : public SimObject { void foo(); EventWrapper&amp;lt;Bar, &amp;amp;Bar::foo&amp;gt; fooEvent; };  When the class Bar is constructed the SimObject (this) pointer must be passed to the fooEvent initializer.</description>

      <description>Tracing Interface Each cpu/thread has a &amp;ldquo;tracer&amp;rdquo; sim object. This defaults to an object which will write to the the same file descriptor as DPRINTFs. If you want, you can nullify the tracer to disable tracing for that cpu/thread. For output you want to be interleaved, use the same trace object (or maybe file?) You could also set up several different files to catch information from each cpu/thread.
There would be other tracer objects you could use instead if you wanted to do something else at each instruction boundary.</description>

      <description>(from Gabe)
I was thinking about how to set up m5 to support other architectures, and decision which has a major impact on that is whether we want to support heterogeneous systems. Here are the arguements I saw for and against.
Against
Adding support for heterogeneous systems will be a big change. There are many systems of m5 that aren&amp;rsquo;t ready to support something that&amp;rsquo;s not alpha, let alone two things.</description>

      <description>To a large extent, the power and flexibility of the ISA description mechanism stem from the fact that the mapping from a brief instruction definition provided in the decode block to the resulting C++ code is performed in a general-purpose programming language (Python). (This function is performed by the &amp;ldquo;instruction format&amp;rdquo; definition described above in Format definitions.) Technically, the ISA description language allows any arbitrary Python code to perform this mapping.</description>

      <description>The purpose of the M5 ISA description system is to generate a decoder function that takes a binary machine instruction and returns a C++ object representing that instruction. The returned object encapsulates all of the information (data and code) needed by the M5 simulator related to that specific machine instruction. By making the object as specific as possible to the machine instruction, the decoding overhead is paid only once; throughout the rest of the simulator, the object makes the needed instruction characteristics accessible easily and with low overhead.</description>

      <description>The M5 ISA description language is a custom language designed specifically for generating the class definitions and decoder function needed by M5. This section provides a practical, informal overview of the language itself. A formal grammar for the language is embedded in the &amp;ldquo;yacc&amp;rdquo; portion of the parser (look for the functions starting with p_ in isa_parser.py). A second major component of the parser processes C-like code specifications to extract instruction characteristics; this aspect is covered in the section Code parsing.</description>

      <description>Vector Architecture Exploration with gem5 (Arm) Abstract The Arm Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) is a key enabling technology to accelerate HPC and machine learning workloads on future Arm-based processors. SVE does not set a specific vector length, which is microarchitecture-specific. This vector-length agnosticism increases design space complexity and exacerbates the importance of having flexible and accurate modeling tools.

      <description>Instruction Schedules &amp;amp; Pipeline Definitions Overview At the heart of the InOrderCPU model is the concept of Instruction Schedules (IS). Instruction schedules create the generic framework that allow for developer&amp;rsquo;s to make a custom pipeline. A pipeline definition can be seen as a collection of instruction schedules that govern what an instruction will do in any given stage and what stage that instruction will go to next.
In general, each instruction has a stage-by-stage list of tasks that need to be accomplished before moving on to the next stage.</description>

      <description>What is gem5? gem5 is a modular discrete event driven computer system simulator platform. That means that:
 gem5&amp;rsquo;s components can be rearranged, parameterized, extended or replaced easily to suit your needs. It simulates the passing of time as a series of discrete events. Its intended use is to simulate one or more computer systems in various ways. It&amp;rsquo;s more than just a simulator; it&amp;rsquo;s a simulator platform that lets you use as many of its premade components as you want to build up your own simulation system.</description>

There is a general 3 step process for doing this:
 compile a cross-compiler capable of building alpha binaries. compile a kernel using this cross-compiler use linux-dist to build binaries for the M5 disk image, and create the image.</description>

L1 Cache is split into Instruction and Data cache. Inclusion is maintained between the L1 and L2 cache. At high level the protocol has four stable states, M, E, S and I. A block in M state means the blocks is writable (i.e. has exclusive permission) and has been dirtied (i.</description>

      <description>Protocol Overview  This is a simple cache coherence protocol that is used to illustrate protocol specification using SLICC. This protocol assumes a 1-level cache hierarchy. The cache is private to each node. The caches are kept coherent by a directory controller. Since the hierarchy is only 1-level, there is no inclusion/exclusion requirement. This protocol does not differentiate between loads and stores. This protocol cannot implement the semantics of LL/SC instructions, because external GETS requests that hit a block within a LL/SC sequence steal exclusive permissions, thus causing the SC instruction to fail.</description>

A fix number of token are assigned to each cache block in the beginning, the number of token remains unchanged.   To write a block, the processor must have all the token for that block.

      <description>This is an implementation of AMD&amp;rsquo;s Hammer protocol, which is used in AMD&amp;rsquo;s Hammer chip (also know as the Opteron or Athlon 64). The protocol implements both the original a HyperTransport protocol, as well as the more recent ProbeFilter protocol. The protocol also includes a full-bit directory mode.

      <description>gem5&amp;rsquo;s memory system was designed to enable:
 Modularity and compartmentalisation through standard interfaces. Suitable interfaces for loosely-timed, approximately-timed and untimed transaction-level modelling. Flexibility to allow other memory interconnects besides a crossbar. A comprehensive set of building blocks, ranging from caches, crossbars, to full-blown DRAM controllers.  Ports system MemObjects All objects within a memory system inherit from MemObject. This class adds the pure virtual functions getMasterPort(const std::string &amp;amp;name) and getSlavePort(const std::string &amp;amp;name) which returns a port corresponding to the given name.</description>

      <description>Repository Management Problem gem5 users typically opt to freeze their repository at a particular changeset when starting a new research project. This approach has several downsides:
 It discourages users from contributing back any useful changes they may develop. If a useful change is added upstream, it&amp;rsquo;s a long, tedious process to update.  If a user chooses to keep their local repository up-to-date with the source tree they typically use named branches and merge any upstream changes into their branches.</description>

      <description>Syntax The assembler is responsible for taking listings similar to traditional assembly and processing it into a set of python objects. The listing is broken into sections which represent macroops or sections of a microcode ROM. In each section, there can be assembler directives and microops. Microops can be preceeded with labels which may be local, or in the case of the ROM, global. The distinction is to allow local labels to be duplicated between sections, but global labels to globally mark a position to, for instance, branch into the ROM or amongst sections of the ROM.</description>

      <description>Introduction We need a way to add/extend/replace cache coherence protocols in a modular fashion. The original cache module had coherence factored out into a separate object, but the interface was totally inadequate for doing anything interesting. The redesigned memory system from 2.0 integrated coherence back in to the cache module as a temporary step to eliminate the useless bloat caused by the original separation. It&amp;rsquo;s now time to go back and re-introduce this modularity, but to do it right this time.</description>

      <description>Running In SE mode, simply create a system with multiple CPUs and assign a different workload object to each CPU&amp;rsquo;s workload parameter. If you&amp;rsquo;re using the O3 model, you can also assign a vector of workload objects to one CPU, in which case the CPU will run all of the workloads concurrently in SMT mode. Note that SE mode has no thread scheduling; if you need a scheduler, run in FS mode and use the fine scheduler built into the Linux kernel.</description>

Getting an list of packets on the ethernet link You can get a list of the packet on the ethernet link by creating a Etherdump object, setting it&amp;rsquo;s file parameter, and setting the dump parameter on the EtherLink to it. This is easily accomplished with our fs.</description>

      <description>Overview Pipeline stages in the InOrder CPU are implemented as abstract implementations of what a pipeline stage would be in any CPU model. Typically, one would imagine a particularly pipeline stage being responsible for:
(1) Performing specific operations such as &amp;ldquo;Decode&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Execute&amp;rdquo; and either
(2a) Sending that instruction to the next stage if that operation was successful and the next stage&amp;rsquo;s buffer has room for incoming instructions

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m putting this in a wiki because I keep asking Nate and I keep forgetting his answer.
Question: Which STL structures might have problems with calling ref counted pointer destructors? Or is it just certain operations like clear()?
Answer: It&amp;rsquo;s with operations like clear. There may be references on them, or when you remove an element from a datastructure like a deque or a queue. If they&amp;rsquo;re implemented in terms of vector, they don&amp;rsquo;t get freed until they&amp;rsquo;re reallocated.</description>

      <description>CPU register indexing in gem5 is a complicated by the need to support multiple ISAs with sometimes very different register semantics (register windows, condition codes, mode-based alternate register sets, etc.). In addition, this support has evolved gradually as new ISAs have been added, so older code may not take advantage of newer features or terminology.
Types of Register Indices There are three types of register indices used internally in the CPU models: relative, unified, and flattened.</description>

      <description>Register windows prove to be a bit problematic with the current model of StaticInsts and the read/write register methods. The issue is that based on the register&amp;rsquo;s index, it is possible that it will be one of the registers whose actual index is determined by a combination of its index and the Current Window Pointer (CWP). In SPARC, r0-r7 are non-windowed registers, while r8-r31 are windowed registers.
StaticInst Register windows provide a form of dynamic renaming that is troublesome with our current StaticInst.</description>

      <description>Overview Resources consists of any CPU object that an instruction wants to access. This could be a branch predictor, a cache, a execution unit, etc. In the InOrder CPU model we abstract what a resource is into a generic &amp;ldquo;Resource&amp;rdquo; class that all specific resources must derive from. In any given pipeline stage, an instruction will request that a resource perform a specific operation on it&amp;rsquo;s behalf. If an instruction can complete all it&amp;rsquo;s resource requests for a given stage, then it may pass to the next stage.</description>

      <description>High level components of Ruby Ruby implements a detailed simulation model for the memory subsystem. It models inclusive/exclusive cache hierarchies with various replacement policies, coherence protocol implementations, interconnection networks, DMA and memory controllers, various sequencers that initiate memory requests and handle responses. The models are modular, flexible and highly configurable. Three key aspects of these models are:
 Separation of concerns &amp;ndash; for example, the coherence protocol specifications are separate from the replacement policies and cache index mapping, the network topology is specified separately from the implementation.</description>

      <description>A cache coherence protocol usually has several different types of state machines, with state machine having several different states. For example, the MESI CMP directory protocol has four different state machines (L1, L2, directory, dma). Testing such a protocol for functional correctness is a challenging task. gem5 provides a random tester for testing coherence protocols. It is called the Ruby Random Tester. The source files related to the tester are present in the directory src/cpu/testers/rubytest.</description>

      <description>This page provides some tips on using M5&amp;rsquo;s build system.
M5&amp;rsquo;s build system uses SCons, a powerful replacement for make (and autoconf, and ccache). SCons uses standard Python to describe the software build process, enabling some very sophisticated &amp;amp; complex build procedures.
This page is not an attempt to fully document the build system. Because many people aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with SCons, and because gem5&amp;rsquo;s build system in some areas takes advantage of the complexity that SCons enables, this page tries to collect useful pointers that might not otherwise be obvious.</description>

      <description>SLICC is a domain specific language for specifying cache coherence protocols. The SLICC compiler generates C++ code for different controllers, which can work in tandem with other parts of Ruby. The compiler also generates an HTML specification of the protocol. HTML generation is turned off by default. To enable HTML output, pass the option &amp;ldquo;SLICC_HTML=True&amp;rdquo; to scons when compiling.
Input To the Compiler The SLICC compiler takes, as input, files that specify the controllers involved in the protocol.</description>

      <description>The SimpleThread class derives from the ThreadState class, and is used to provide all architectural state for models that don&amp;rsquo;t need anything more complex. It is basically the context of a hardware thread, and provides all necessary functions needed to access it as defined by the ThreadContext class. However, SimpleThread does not actually derive from ThreadContext, but rather uses a proxy class to forward all ThreadContext function calls to its own functions.</description>

      <description>Simulation scripts control the configuration and execution of gem5 simulations. The gem5 simulator itself is basically passive; on invoking gem5, it simply executes the user&amp;rsquo;s simulation script, and performs actions only when called by the script.
Simulation scripts are written in Python and executed by the Python interpreter. Currently, the interpreter is linked into the gem5 executable, but for most purposes the script&amp;rsquo;s execution should be indistinguishable from invoking the Python interpreter directly.</description>

      <description>ThreadContext is the interface to all state of a thread for anything outside of the CPU. It provides methods to read or write state that might be needed by external objects, such as the PC, next PC, integer and FP registers, and IPRs. It also provides functions to get pointers to important thread-related classes, such as the ITB, DTB, System, kernel statistics, and memory ports. It is an abstract base class; the CPU must create its own ThreadContext by either deriving from it, or using the templated ProxyThreadContext class.</description>

      <description>The ThreadState class is used to hold thread state that is common across CPU models, such as the thread ID, thread status, kernel statistics, memory port pointers, and some statistics of number of instructions completed. Each CPU model can derive from ThreadState and build upon it, adding in thread state that is deemed appropriate. An example of this is SimpleThread, where all of the thread&amp;rsquo;s architectural state has been added in.</description>

      <description>Building Android KitKat for gem5 Overview The easiest way to build Android for gem5 is to base the system on a the emulated Goldfish device. The main difference between the actual qemu-based Goldfish model and gem5 is a small number of gem5-specific configuration files. These files are mainly related to differences in block device naming and scripts to start use gem5&amp;rsquo;s pseudo-op interface to start experiments.

      <description>The DynInst is used to hold dynamic information about instructions. This is necessary for more detailed models or out-of-order models, both of which may need extra information beyond the StaticInst in order to correctly execute instructions.
Some of the dynamic information that it stores includes:
 The PC of the instruction The renamed register indices of the source and destination registers The predicted next-PC The instruction result The thread number of the instruction The CPU the instruction is executing on Whether or not the instruction is squashed  Additionally the DynInst provides the ExecContext interface.</description>

      <description>The current serialization system uses a .ini file format. Each section refers to a specific object instance, and the values within a section are the serialized data for that instance. The section heading is the name() of the object and all hierarchy is essentially flattened.
During the serialization process, the file is directly written out as objects are serialized, without any intermediate buffering. The serialization proceeds by doing the global serialization then by serializing each SimObject.</description>

      <description>The gem5 ISA description language is a custom language designed specifically for generating the class definitions and decoder function needed by M5. This section provides a practical, informal overview of the language itself. A formal grammar for the language is embedded in the &amp;ldquo;yacc&amp;rdquo; portion of the parser (look for the functions starting with p_ in isa_parser.py). A second major component of the parser processes C-like code specifications to extract instruction characteristics; this aspect is covered in the section Code parsing.</description>

      <description>Saving/Restoring object state Dealing with Events Handling SimObject Pointers Phases of Object Initialization If restoring from a checkpoint, loadState(ckpt) is called on each SimObject. The default implementation simply calls unserialize() if there is a corresponding checkpoint section, so we get backward compatibility for existing objects. However, objects can override loadState() to get other behaviors, e.g., doing other programmed initializations after unserialize(), or complaining if no checkpoint section is found. (Note that the default warning for a missing checkpoint section is now gone.</description>

      <description>It is possible to run the SPLASH-2 benchmarks on M5 in two different ways, each with their own caveats.
Using full-system mode The most robust approach is to compile the benchmarks using a Pthreads implementation of the PARMACS macros, then link with the standard Linux Pthreads library and run this binary on M5 under full-system mode.
Advantages:
 Realistic: you&amp;rsquo;re getting the actual Linux thread scheduler to schedule your threads Robust (in contrast to current SE-mode approaches&amp;hellip; see below) You can build a cross-compiler to compile the binaries on non-Alpha platforms (see Using linux-dist to Create Disk Images and Kernels for M5&amp;hellip; note that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to build a kernel, just the cross-compiler).</description>

      <description>The particular installation of the Python interpreter that executes the SCons build scripts is also linked with M5 to execute runtime Python simulation scripts. (This correspondence is necessary since some Python code is shared between the build process and runtime execution.) As a result, you can get M5 to link with a non-default installation of the Python interpreter by using that instance of the interpreter to execute the SCons scripts.</description>

      <description>Bitfield functions BitUnion classes FastAlloc FastAlloc has been removed from the code base since late May 2012. Instead the build scripts will pick up tcmalloc (a malloc() version used also at Google), the observed performance gain of replacing tcmalloc over fastalloc is around 6%.
IntMath panic, fatal, warn, inform, hack: which? There are error and warning functions defined in src/base/misc.hh: panic(), fatal(), warn(), inform(), and hack(). The first two functional have nearly the same effect (printing an error message and terminating the simulation), and the latter three print a message and continue.</description>

      <description>This page contains information about different types of information visualization that is integrated or can be used with gem5.
O3 Pipeline Viewer The o3 pipeline viewer is a text based viewer of the out-of-order CPU pipeline. It shows when instructions are fetched (f), decoded (d), renamed (n), dispatched (p), issued (i), completed &amp;copy;, and retired &amp;reg;. It is very useful for understanding where the pipeline is stalling or squashing in a reasonable small sequence of code.</description>

      <description>This page contains instructions for building up-to-date kernels for gem5 running on ARM.
Prerequisites These instructions are for running headless systems. That is a more &amp;ldquo;server&amp;rdquo; style system where there is no frame-buffer. The description has been created using the latest known-working tag in the repositories linked below, however the tables in each section list previous tags that are known to work. To built the kernels on an x86 host you&amp;rsquo;ll need ARM cross compilers and the device tree compiler.</description>

      <description>Full-System Stuff You would need one or more of the following files to full system simulations using gem5. If you download these files, read this page for instructions on how to install these files.
 ARM  ARM Full-System Files &amp;ndash; Pre-compiled kernel and disk images for 32-bit and 64-bit ARM simulation. Updated October 2014. There kernels all support PCIe devices and the 64-bit kernels support &amp;gt;2GB of DRAM.

      <description>The latest gem5 source code is available via our Git repository host at https://gem5.googlesource.com. It is strongly recommend that you get a copy of gem5 by using git. You can get more info about the repository and git here. In additional to the main git repository, there is a mirror on GitHub (we can&amp;rsquo;t currently accept pull requests on GitHub) and a Mercurial mirror. Keep in mind that the mirrors are read only.</description>

      <description>Full system code locations are as follows:
 /sim/system - Architecture and OS independent code /arch//system.(cc|hh) - Architecture dependent, OS independent code /arch///system.(cc|hh) - - Architecture dependent, OS dependent code /kern//* - Architecture independent, OS dependent code  Very little of the code that was in /kern/ was actually architecture independent. Even things that at first glance appeared to be, actually patched architecture dependent parts of the kernel. Since there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much shared code, I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel any any large amount of effort should be put into sharing litterally 3 lines so unless we find a place where there is a lot of code, os dependent architecture independent code should go in it&amp;rsquo;s proper directory in a namespace for that OS and simply be called by the source architecture and os dependend files.</description>

      <description>title: &amp;ldquo;I/O Base Classes&amp;rdquo; date: 2018-05-13T18:51:37-04:00
draft: false The base classes in src/dev/io_device.* allow devices to be created with reasonable ease. The classes and virtual functions that must be implemented are listed below. Before reading the following it will help to be familiar with the Memory_System.
PioPort The PioPort class is a programmed I/O port that all devices that are sensitive to an address range use. The port takes all the memory access types and roles them into one read() and write() call that the device must respond to.</description>
